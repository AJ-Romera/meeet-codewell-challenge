This is my first html5 & CSS practice since my comeback days ago. I´m testing myself with this challenge:

## Final Thoughts

I made a landing page template, a bit responsive for some desktops, tablets and mobile. Did it with an mobile-first approach.
The positioning was challenging for me, I think I should use background positioning next time. Also on desktop there´s a "N" on the word EntrepreNeurs that has a different z-index, I didn´t make it because I have to remember JS.

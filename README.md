# Codewell´s Meeet Challenge accepted!

This is my first html5 & CSS practice since my comeback days ago. I´m testing myself with this challenge:

[Codewell´s Meeet Challenge](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges/meeet-waitlist-template--60e05defa383e41090a3c273)

I have to make a small landing page, this challenge is perfect to practice positioning and refreshing my skills. I should make it responsive too (I´ll try a mobile first approach) for mobile, tablet and desktop.
